It passes through the 'star' accelerating exponentially when approaching. It then speeds through the star in the original direction it was going. This shows us the limitation of our modelling as it doesn't consider the case of collision. This helps explain the cases for F3 and D.\n",

This is seen more in the yellow planet. Finally the planets fall into an equilibirum where they consistently orbit along the same path. Potentially, this is the orbit's initial kinetic energy causing the initial instability, once both planets have their kinetic energies expended, they fall into the equilibrium."

However due to limitations of scaling it to be visible, I quickly moved on to basing the model on the circular orbit seen in the test animation. (0,2,0) & (0,2.5,0) Being the positional vector of the planets, (-22,0,0) being initial velocity of both planet, 2 being the mass of both plants and mass of tje star being 1000.    \n",

This was so that they would experience weaker amounts gravitational attraction and be able to have more influence on each other.
